## Description

Review sprint for week 38.

## Review

I set up my agile environment this week and then started working on the Brand Strategy Sprint first week. I learned about:
### - Three lines of business
1. Perceived Value
2. Price
3. Cost to produce
### - Clock Model
### - Pre, post, and purchase phases
### - Three Hurdles Framework
1. Differentiation - stands out vs other similar things
2. Relevance - Does anyone care
3. Sustainability - Can we keep it going


More on this later when I can move my notes over.


## Functionality

- Blog posts - Create to narate work
- Stories - One for each feature to implement
- Sprints - Groups stories into 1 week time periods
- Backlog/Done - Easy view status of stories

## Workflow

This is the approach I took for the first sprint, it seems to mostly work, but there are probably some areas that could be improved/streamlined:

- When a story idea arises, create a story with 'backlog' tag, add any details that are known
- Each day, write a blog post describing in a general way what has been done on previous day, and what is to be done that day
- Update stories with implementation details and task list
- Create a feature branch for each story, then a sub branch for each coding task
- Once story is completed, update the 'backlog' tag to 'done'
- Merge sub branches when theny are complete into story branch
- Merge story branch into master
- Do a retrospective at the end of the week

## Questions

- Where should links to blog post written during the sprint be added?
- Should completed sprints be displayed with strikethrough?
- Should there be a way to view in progress stories?
- Is the feature branch / sub task branch technique error prone? (It's easy to merge task into the wrong branch)
- Should story pages display currently assigned tags?
