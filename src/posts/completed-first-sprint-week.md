I completed the [first sprint week yesterday](/sprints/Week_34-2020_08_17-2020_08_23/). All stories were completed.

Since I used Dendron notes in my VS Code environment and didn't have my website completely ready for the sprint as I worked through it, there will be missing stories and posts right now. Bear with me as I catch everything up during the second week.

Today I will create a new sprint and add some stories and do a retrospective of the previous sprint. I will also get ready for the upcoming content in the Brand Strategy Sprint.

# Reflection on the first week
The first week was very fun! I always love the cohort meetups, so I have to say that it was my favorite part so far. The first two modules weren't anything too crazy, but they were new frameworks to me - at least framed differently than how I had learned these topics before.

# Key Takeaways
- Create strong emotional associations to your brand to make it stick with your customers. Increase perceived value to make your brand stronger.
- Tar Heel Dev Studio and GeauxWeisbeck4 both will focus on post-purchase branding because that is where all the real work on my projects happens. Provide outstanding service, create easy to use interfaces, and solve their problems.
  - What other frameworks that I have learned can I include?

# Ideas
- Implement this agile framework for my whole Section 4 website and start implementing other frameworks as well.
