# Geaux Brand Strategy Sprint
This is for the Brand Strategy Sprint, but it is kind of my draft for developing the Geaux Sprint System. The Geaux Sprint System is my newest project in which I will eventually build out a static site generator and CMS solely dedicated to efficiency and productivity. There will also be a focus on creating themes/templates that are business framework oriented, or aimed at creating new opportunities - for example a business plan template that is a workflow to create an optimal plan to get funding for  your project.

## This sprint
I will demonstrate the flow of things using the Eleventy Agile Starter project and introduce my product to the sprint.
